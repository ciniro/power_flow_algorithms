# power_flow_algorithms
This repository contains several algorithms for performing the power flow calculation (DC and AC) involvingoptimization. The source codes made available here were developed by me in R programming language as tasks for the discipline of Static Analysis of Electric Energy Systems in the Doctorate of the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering at USP (SÃ£o Carlos). If you use the source code, please include the reference to my name and this repository. I am available to answer any questions by my personal email: ciniro@gmail.com.
